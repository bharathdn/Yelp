### Basic Yelp client

This is a headless example of how to implement an OAuth 1.0a Yelp API client. The Yelp API provides an application token that allows applications to make unauthenticated re# Project 2 - *Name of App Here*

**YelpApp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **18** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Search results page
   - [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
   - [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
   - [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
- [x] Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
   - [x] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
   - [x] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
   - [x] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
   - [ ] Optional: implement a custom switch
   - [x] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search results page
   - [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Filter page
   - [ ] Implement a custom switch instead of the default UISwitch.
   - [ ] Distance filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
   - [ ] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is [here](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list).
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Force touch options
2. Using Cocoapods to improve UI

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* Implemeting Maps and assigning pins to locations 
* The search results page displays differnt kinds of results such as: search results, default results, results from filters page. Maintaining the state for these criteria got tough as more functionalities were added. Sometimes the infiite scroll chanegs the search criteria!

### Sample request

**Basic search with query**

```
Business.searchWithTerm("Thai", completion: { (businesses: [Business]!, error: NSError!) -> Void in
    self.businesses = businesses
    
    for business in businesses {
        print(business.name!)
        print(business.address!)
    }
})
```

**Advanced search with categories, sort, and deal filters**

```
Business.searchWithTerm("Restaurants", sort: .Distance, categories: ["asianfusion", "burgers"], deals: true) { (businesses: [Business]!, error: NSError!) -> Void in

    for business in businesses {
        print(business.name!)
        print(business.address!)
    }
}
```
